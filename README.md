# Semantic Parsing Web Application

Warning: Work in Progress!

WebApp to connect with Google Colab for Natural Language parsing of text to SQL.


The idea is to allow user to enter database schema, and then feed in natural language question(s) to produce complex SQL queries (think 10 way joins, filtering, aggregations, primary keys, foreign keys and irregular names for table names and column names).
